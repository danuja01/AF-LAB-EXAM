# Question

In this one-hour challenge, you are required to create a Music Player Application using React with state management using either Context API or Redux. The application should allow users to manage their music library and play songs.

Here are the requirements for the Music Player Application:

- Home page: Display a list of songs and playlists.
- Song page: Show a list of songs with an option to add, edit, and delete songs.
- Playlist page: Show a list of playlists with an option to create, edit, and delete playlists.
- Song Detail page: Display the details of a selected song, including its title, artist, album, and duration. Users should be able to play and pause songs.
- Playlist Detail page: Display the details of a selected playlist, including its name, description, and songs. Users should be able to add and remove songs from the playlist.
- Music Player: Implement a music player component that allows users to control playback, skip to the next or previous song, and adjust the volume.
- Navigation: Implement navigation to switch between the pages.
- State Management: Use either Context API or Redux for state management.

Note that there is no need to connect a backend for this assignment. The focus should be on the React implementation and state management. The code should be well-organized and easy to understand.
