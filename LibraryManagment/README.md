# Question

In this one-hour challenge, you are required to create a Library Management System using React
with state management using either Context API or Redux. The system should be able to perform
basic CRUD operations on books and users.

Here are the requirements for the Library Management System:

- Home page: Display a list of books and users.
- Book page: Show a list of books with an option to add, edit, and delete books.
- User page: Show a list of users with an option to add, edit, and delete users.
- Book Detail page: Display the details of a selected book, including its title, author,
  publication date, and available copies. Users should be able to borrow and return books.
- User Detail page: Display the details of a selected user, including their name, email,
  phone number, and borrowed books.
- Navigation: Implement navigation to switch between the pages.
- State Management: Use either Context API or Redux for state management.

Note that there is no need to connect a backend for this assignment. The focus should be on the React implementation and state management. The code should be well-organized and easy to
understand.
