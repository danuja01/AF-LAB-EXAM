# Challenge

In this one-hour challenge, you are required to create a Power Equipment Renting System using React with state management using either Context API or Redux. The system should be able to perform basic CRUD operations on equipment and customers.

Here are the requirements for the Power Equipment Renting System:

- Home page: Display a list of equipment and customers.
- Equipment page: Show a list of equipment with an option to add, edit, and delete
  equipment.
- Customer page: Show a list of customers with an option to add, edit, and delete
  customers.
- Equipment Detail page: Display the details of a selected equipment, including its name,
  description, rental price, and availability. Customers should be able to rent and return
  equipment.
- Customer Detail page: Display the details of a selected customer, including their name,
  address, phone number, and rented equipment.
- Navigation: Implement navigation to switch between the pages.
- State Management: Use either Context API or Redux for state management.

Note that there is no need to connect a backend for this assignment. The focus should be on
the React implementation and state management. The code should be well-organized and easy to
understand.
